# Developing Food Bank and Restaurant Partnerships

Food insecurity is a prevalent issue that dominates underserved communities in this U.S. In conjunction with lack of food, the United States also has a food waste dilemma. The question our team intends to answer is if we can create a network of food partnerships with restaurants, grocery stores, and food banks. L.A. county is the most populated county in the United States and is currently dealing with food insecurity and a food waste problem. It currently produces 4,000 to 6,000 tons per day of food waste, at the same time, 1 in 9 Californians lacks adequate access to food. According to the NRDC, up to 40% of food in the United States is wasted, so our goal is to connect private businesses with non-profit food banks in order build food donation partnerships to increase food diversity and eliminate waste.
	
**How do we create a network of potential food partnerships?**
1. Restaurant proximity to food banks (distance from food bank)
* We found more than enough restaurants within a 5 mile radius. Yelp limited us to 50 restaurants even though there were more within the radius. From here we decided to further narrow down the restaurant list along with finding  additional food sources.
2. Map of additional food donation sources (distance from food bank)
* Similar to the restaurants there were plenty of grocery stores but we noticed they had fewer numbers. This was expected but confirmed our belief that restaurants were a more ideal target than grocery stores based on how many different options we could pursue. Together, there were more than 100+ restaurants and grocery stores within our 5 miles radius. While building our overlap, we saw that restaurants were closer than most grocery stores and this reinforced to us that restaurants should be our primary target. From here we want to see what the average price was and what the most typical cuisines were to see what what the quality and type of ingredients the restaurants around our food banks had.
	

**What are the types of donation sources?**

3. Diversity of foods donated (cuisine types)
* We wanted to look at the allocation of cuisine types to be mindful of the what types of ingredients they may have. Using Yelps labels we cleaned up more than 20 types of food and narrowed it to 5 categories;  American, Asian, European, Lation, and bar food. We found a majority of the restaurants were American followed by Asian and European. Looking deeper into these restaurants we can figure out what raw materials they use. Next we want to figure the quality of those raw materials by looking at the prices. 
4. Price range (tell us about the types of restaurants)
* Looking at these restaurants we used the Yelp $ figure to see how expensive the restaurants were, we saw 58% of restaurants were 2 $$, 24% of restaurants were unlabeled, and 12% were $$$$. This showed us that most restaurants are either extremely expensive or more affordable. Because there were more 2 $$ restaurants, we could look at the ones with the most reviews to look further into the restaurants to analyze their ingredients more closely.

**What restaurants do we want to target for partnerships?**

5. Number of reviews and ratings (insight: popularity; brand recognition; desirability of partnership)
* We wanted to look at reviews and ratings for two reasons, 1) we wanted to know if people rated their food highly and 2) we wanted to reach out to these restaurants for brand impact and recognition. We found almost all restaurants within the radius had 4 stars or above- this showed us we didn't have to exclude any in particular. After looking at the review count we found Bottega Louie, Wurstkuche, Perch, Howlin’ Ray’s, Bestia, Republique, Poppy + Rose, Dirt Dog, Little Sister, Bavel had the most reviews. These stood out to us to look into further for partnerships. We would also mention to these restaurants the tax benefits of donating extra food.

6. What does the intersection tell us of who we should target 
* The final variables we used were distances, review count, and ability to deliver. We decided on these factors because we wanted the restaurants to be close, be publicly vetted for quality, and eliminate the need to find a 3rd party to deliver their food. We came up with 10 restaurants within 5 miles that had the most reviews that also delivered. These would be our primary targets and we also found 4 grocery stores that delivered. Our primary restaurant targets Wurstkuche, Bestia, Marugame Monzo, Faith and Flower, and Dirt Dog.


Using these data driven insights, the food bank can take this information and pursue partnerships with these restaurants to always have a supply of quality food. Simultaneously, the restaurants will have less food waste and overall food distribution will be more effective.
