# Developing Food Bank and Restaurant Partnerships

Food insecurity is a prevalent issue that dominates underserved communities in this U.S, in conjunction with lack of food, the United States also has a food waste dilemma. The question Team Officious Ox intends to answer is if we can create a network of food partnerships with restaurants, grocery stores, and food delivery services in order to efficiently broker a link to food banks. L.A. county is the most populated county in the United States  and is currently dealing with food insecurity and waste problem. L.A. County currently produces 4,000 to 6,000 tons per day of food waste, at the same time, 1 in 9 Californians lacks adequate access to food. According to the NRDC, up to 40% of food in the United States is wasted, so therein lays a problem of connecting private businesses with non-profit food banks in order build food donation partnerships to increase food diversity and eliminate waste.
	
**How do we create a network of potential food partnerships?**
1. Restaurant proximity to food banks (distance from food bank)
* We found more than enough restaurants within a 5 mile radius, Yelp limited us to 50 restaurants even though there were more within the radius. From here we decided to further narrow down the restaurant list along with finding  additional food sources.
2. Map of additional food donation sources (distance from food bank)
* Similar to the restaurants there were plenty of grocery stores but less grocery stores to restaurants , this was expected but confirmed our belief. Together, there were more than 100+ restaurants and grocery stores within our 5 miles radius. While locating at our overlap, we saw that restaurants were closer than most grocery stores because of this our first targets would be restaurants. From here we want to see what grocery stores and restaurants can deliver. 
	

*What are the types of donation sources?*

3. Diversity of foods donated
* Being mindful of the certain types of food that maybe lacking from food banks we wanted to look at the allocation of cuisine types. Certain types of cuisine will have more ingredients, using Yelps labels we cleaned up more than 20 types of food and narrowed it to 5 categories;  American, Asian, European, Lation, and bar food. We found a majority of the restaurants were American followed by Asian and European. Looking deeper into these restaurants we can figure out what raw materials they use. Next we want to figure the quality of those raw materials by looking at the prices. 
4. Price range (tell us about the types of restaurants)
* Looking at these restaurants we used the Yelp $ figure to see how expensive the restaurants were, we saw 58% of restaurants were 2 $$, 24% of restaurants were unlabeled, and 12% were $$$$. This showed us that most restaurants are either extremely expensive or more affordable. Using this data we look at the $$ restaurants more closely to analyze their ingredients . 


*What restaurants do we want to target for partnerships?* 

5. Nuumber of reviews and ratings (insight: popularity; brand recognition; desirability of partnership)
* We wanted to look at reviews and ratings for two reasons, one we wanted to know if people rated their food highly and two we wanted to reach out to these restaurants for brand impact and recognition. We found almost all restaurants within the radius had 4 stars or above, this showed us we didn't have to exclude any in particular. After looking at the review count  we found Bottega Louie, Wurstkuche, Perch, Howlin’ Ray’s, Bestia, Republique, Poppy + Rose, Dirt Dog, Little Sister, Bavel had the most reviews.These stood out us to look into further for partnerships. 

6. What does the intersection tell us of who we should target 
* The final variables we used were distances, review count, and ability to deliver. We came up with 10 restaurants within 5 miles that had the most reviews that also delivered. These would be our primary targets and we also found 4 grocery stores that delivered. Our primary restaurant targets Wurstkuche, Bestia, Marugame Monzo, Faith and Flower, and Dirt Dog.
